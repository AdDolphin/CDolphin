**CDolphin** is a Windows application designed to automate the process of building C++ applications with G++. It simplifies the build and compile process for C++ developers, making it easier to manage project files and dependencies.

## Features

- Automates the C++ to G++ build process.
- Supports managing project files and dependencies.
- Easy-to-use command-line interface with a clean, user-friendly interface.
- Platform support for Windows, Linux, and MacOS.
- ASCII-art representation of the "eye" and a custom menu interface for a more engaging user experience.
- Automatically creates a build directory if not already present.
- Compilation commands are platform-specific, making it compatible with various operating systems.

## Installation

1. **Download the executable**:  
   Download the `CDolphin` file from the [releases page](https://github.com/AdDolphin/CDolphin/releases).

2. **Run the program**:  
   Open the folder where you downloaded the `Build.exe` and double-click to run it. This will open a console window.

3. **Configure and Build your project**:  
   Once the console window is open, use the command-line interface to configure and compile your project.

## How to Use

### 1. Select a Platform:
   - Launch the application, and the main menu will prompt you to choose a platform. Enter one of the following options:
     - **Windows**
     - **Linux**
     - **Mac OS**
   - The selected platform will be used for compiling the C++ code.

### 2. Build a C++ Project:
   - Enter the name of your program when prompted.
   - Enter the version number of your program.
   - The application will then gather all source files from the `src/` folder and compile them into a project build in the `build/` directory.

### 3. Menu Options:
   - **Option 1**: Start the build process for the selected platform.
   - **Option 2**: Choose a platform (Windows, Linux, Mac OS).
   - **Option 3**: Exit the application.

## Example Usage

1. After running `Build.exe`, you will be presented with the following options:
   Build program
   Choose platform
